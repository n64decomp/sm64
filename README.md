# Super Mario 64 Port

- This repo contains a full decompilation of Super Mario 64 (J), (U), (E), and (SH).
- Naming and documentation of the source code and data structures are in progress.
- Beyond Nintendo 64, it can also target Linux and Windows natively.

This repo does not include all assets necessary for compiling the game.
A prior copy of the game is required to extract the assets.

## Building native executables

### Linux

1. Install prerequisites (Ubuntu): `sudo apt install -y git build-essential pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev libsdl2-dev`.
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64-port.git`, which will create a directory `sm64-port` and then **enter** it `cd sm64-port`.
3. Place a Super Mario 64 ROM called `baserom.<VERSION>.z64` into the repository's root directory for asset extraction, where `VERSION` can be `us`, `jp`, or `eu`.
4. Run `make` to build. Qualify the version through `make VERSION=<VERSION>`. Add `-j4` to improve build speed (hardware dependent based on the amount of CPU cores available).
5. The executable binary will be located at `build/<VERSION>_pc/sm64.<VERSION>.f3dex2e`.

### Windows

1. Install and update MSYS2, following all the directions listed on https://www.msys2.org/.
2. From the start menu, launch MSYS2 MinGW and install required packages depending on your machine (do **NOT** launch "MSYS2 MSYS"):
  * 64-bit: Launch "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit" and install: `pacman -S git make python3 mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc`
  * 32-bit (will also work on 64-bit machines): Launch "MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit" and install: `pacman -S git make python3 mingw-w64-i686-gcc`
  * Do **NOT** by mistake install the package called simply `gcc`.
3. The MSYS2 terminal has a _current working directory_ that initially is `C:\msys64\home\<username>` (home directory). At the prompt, you will see the current working directory in yellow. `~` is an alias for the home directory. You can change the current working directory to `My Documents` by entering `cd /c/Users/<username>/Documents`.
4. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64-port.git`, which will create a directory `sm64-port` and then **enter** it `cd sm64-port`.
5. Place a *Super Mario 64* ROM called `baserom.<VERSION>.z64` into the repository's root directory for asset extraction, where `VERSION` can be `us`, `jp`, or `eu`.
6. Run `make` to build. Qualify the version through `make VERSION=<VERSION>`. Add `-j4` to improve build speed (hardware dependent based on the amount of CPU cores available).
7. The executable binary will be located at `build/<VERSION>_pc/sm64.<VERSION>.f3dex2e.exe` inside the repository.

#### Troubleshooting

1. If you get `make: gcc: command not found` or `make: gcc: No such file or directory` although the packages did successfully install, you probably launched the wrong MSYS2. Read the instructions again. The terminal prompt should contain "MINGW32" or "MINGW64" in purple text, and **NOT** "MSYS".
2. If you get `Failed to open baserom.us.z64!` you failed to place the baserom in the repository. You can write `ls` to list the files in the current working directory. If you are in the `sm64-port` directory, make sure you see it here.
3. If you get `make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop.`, you are not in the correct directory. Make sure the yellow text in the terminal ends with `sm64-port`. Use `cd <dir>` to enter the correct directory. If you write `ls` you should see all the project files, including `Makefile` if everything is correct.
4. If you get any error, be sure MSYS2 packages are up to date by executing `pacman -Syu` and `pacman -Su`. If the MSYS2 window closes immediately after opening it, restart your computer.
5. When you execute `gcc -v`, be sure you see `Target: i686-w64-mingw32` or `Target: x86_64-w64-mingw32`. If you see `Target: x86_64-pc-msys`, you either opened the wrong MSYS start menu entry or installed the incorrect gcc package.
6. When switching between building for other platforms, run `make -C tools clean` first to allow for the tools to recompile on the new platform. This also helps when switching between shells like WSL and MSYS2.

### Debugging

The code can be debugged using `gdb`. On Linux install the `gdb` package and execute `gdb <executable>`. On MSYS2 install by executing `pacman -S winpty gdb` and execute `winpty gdb <executable>`. The `winpty` program makes sure the keyboard works correctly in the terminal. Also consider changing the `-mwindows` compile flag to `-mconsole` to be able to see stdout/stderr as well as be able to press Ctrl+C to interrupt the program. In the Makefile, make sure you compile the sources using `-g` rather than `-O2` to include debugging symbols. See any online tutorial for how to use gdb.

## ROM building

It is possible to build N64 ROMs as well with this repository. See https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64 for instructions.
